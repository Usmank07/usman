5.	Include anything else you think is important! Think of this as you pitching an API to your team at work , what does the team need to know about this API to safely accept it and add it to there application.

-some good applications to add on would be error handling to ensure any possible errors such as invalid API keys, rate limit exceeded, or invalid parameters. Data validation could also be helpful where it validates the data recieved from the API to ensure it meets the requirements before moving further.
